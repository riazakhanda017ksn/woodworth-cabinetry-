          <p>
            This warranty shall become void if the cabinets, cabinetwork, drawer

            only parts and materials of the cabinets with the brand name,

          <h5 className="mb-3">Disclaimers</h5>
          <p>
            The following is a brief recap of some of the characteristics of the
            wood and finishes on the cabinets you are about to purchase. Please
            read them carefully. If some of these characteristics concern you,
            please choose something else. We bring these characteristics to your
            attention so you will realize that Woodworth Cabinetry will not be
            held responsible for these variations in your cabinet. It is
            important to note that wood products claimed as defective are most
            often the result of atmospheric conditions such as excess moisture
            and humidity. Woodworth Cabinetry strongly recommends testing the
            intended location of the products for such conditions prior to
            installation. WOOD AND COLOR VARIATIONS: Wood is a product of
            nature, and since no two trees are alike, cabinets may vary in
            color, texture and grain. Wood characteristics naturally occurring
            such as variations in color, grain, mineral streaks, pinholes and
            knots are not considered defects. Color variations in cabinets are
            also a natural occurrence due to species, age or character of
            cabinets, or exposure to UV light and sunlight. For these reasons,
            new or replacement cabinets may not match display samples or
            existing cabinets. This may result in overall color variations, but
            is not considered a defect. WOOD DOORS: Wood by nature will undergo
            expansion and contraction movements year after year as it
            compensates and adjusts to ever changing atmospheric humidity and
            temperature conditions. It is very common for center panels on doors
            to shrink, expand or move during these transitions. Typically, the
            panel will return to its normal position within a year once it has
            adjusted to seasonal changes. It is for these same reasons that it
            is very common for doors to warp during these periods. Doors that
            are warped up to 1’4” are not considered defective. Note: It is
            advisable to check if the door was properly installed, since doors
            that appear warped are very often the result of improper
            installation. PAINTED FINISHES: Birch is a non-porous, smooth
            grained wood. Additionally, wood by nature undergoes periods of
            expansion and contraction while it adjusts to atmospheric conditions
            mentioned above. As such, finish stress lines may become visible on
            painted cabinets especially at the joints. Any such occurrence is
            not considered a defect. GLAZED FINISHES: A glazed finish by
            character is an uneven finish. Some edges and profiles will have
            heavier hang up than others and glazing may vary from cabinet to
            cabinet, door to drawer and item to item. This may result in overall
            color variations but is not considered a defect.

          <p>
            If a defect does occur within the terms and conditions of this
            warranty, such defective part will be repaired or replaced by
            Woodworth Cabinetry at its sole discretion. Woodworth Cabinetry will
            not provide or pay for the cost of removal of defective product,
            transportation of defective, repaired or replaced product or
            installation of repaired or replaced product. Woodworth Cabinetry
            will not be responsible for any damages to the defective, replaced
            or repaired product occurred during its shipment or transportation.
            If any defective item has been discontinued or is not available at
            the time, Woodworth Cabinetry reserves the right to replace the item
            with the most similar item available in Woodworth Cabinetry’s
            inventory at that time. Woodworth Cabinetry cannot guarantee that
            the finish of any replacement will exactly match the finish and
            appearance of the defective item due to the natural aging process of
            wood and finishes of cabinets. Woodworth Cabinetry may require at
            its discretion that the costumer submit a clear photo, or that a
            company representative view the item being claimed before honoring
            this warranty.
