            Our new headquarters is a one-million square foot state of the art
            production hub nestled on the Passaic River in Newark. It
            consolidates all four of our previous spaces into one
            superstructure. With this extraordinary advancement, wood worth
            cabinetry is destined for exponential growth. The new building
            supports our vision with spaces that intentionally foster a
            transparent environment and encourage the enjoyment of discovery.
            This makes wood worth cabinetry a place where people are happy to
            come and innovate.
